<h2>INTRO(1): introduction to clive</h2>
<hr>
<p>

<a name="sec1"></a><h2>USAGE</h2>
<p><ul style="list-style:none;">
    <code><pre>
    ; Importzx
    ; export GOROOT=/zx/sys/golang
    ; export PLAN9=/plan9
    ; export CPUTYPE=darwin_amd64
    ; export GOPATH=/zx/usr/$USER/gosrc

<p>
</ul><p>
<a name="sec2"></a><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
Clive is a system built out of services interconnected through
channels and other network connections. Processes in clive run on
other hosted operating systems, because there is no native clive
kernel as of now.
<p>
The central part of the system is a file system (or rather, a set of
file systems) exported through the zx protocol. The file system(s) may
be mounted on UNIX-like systems through fuse, to permit alien (UNIX)
commands to operate on Clive services. The Clive shell and other clive
commands know how to speak zx directly to Clive servers.
<p>
The main tree is usually mounted at <code>/zx</code> and
its dump can be found at <code>/dump</code>. The
<code>/once</code> tree keeps stuff not be dumped. The
tree at <code>/x</code> is used to request command
execution via <a href="//lsub.org/sys/man/1/xcmd.html">xcmd(1)</a>.
The dump contains a frozen version of the main tree for each day.
Directories named <code>tmp</code> or
<code>tmp.*</code> or <code>*.tmp</code> or
containing a file named <code>NODUMP</code> are never
copied to the dump. Files with names starting with a dot character
(<code>.</code>) are never dumped. See
<a href="//lsub.org/sys/man/3/nspace.html">nspace(3)</a> for the
conventions of the name space.
<p>
File system services are split into <em>finders</em> and
<em>zx file trees.</em> Most Clive servers are both
finders and file trees.
<p>
A finder accepts find requests to find directory entries. A file tree
accepts file operations on directory entries. Directory entries are
sets of name/value pairs, where certain attributes are expected to
exist.
<p>
Clive commands carry a per-process name-space where foreign (UNIX) or
zx file systems may be imported. The name space maps name prefixes to
ordered sets of directory entries and accepts find requests to gather
directory entries of interest. The name space is initialized by
inspecting the <code>NS</code> environment variable, which
can be adjusted at will for different commands, and inherited when new
processes are created.
<p>
Command I/O relies on input and output channels, carrying data as byte
arrays, directory entries, file addresses, and other types in general.
Each channel has a name and it is customary to use
<em>in</em>, <em>out</em>, and
<em>err</em> to represent the channels for standard input,
output, and error.
<p>
Commands executed within
<a href="//lsub.org/sys/man/1/ix.html">ix(1)</a> also have the
<em>ink</em> output channel, used to let them output
graphical interfaces and requests for <em>ix</em> to look
for things or to execute commands.
<p>
Some commands accept a configuration file. The convention is to
provide the configuration in the environment, or in a file at
<code>$home/lib</code>, or in a dot-file at
<code>$home</code>. For example,
<a href="//lsub.org/sys/man/1/ql.html">ql(1)</a> looks for
<code>$ql</code>, or the file
<code>$home/lib/ql</code>, or the file
<code>$home/.ql</code>.
<p>
File names given to most commands are a combination of a file (path)
name and a predicate. Either (or both) may be missing from a name. The
file name along with the predicate is used to select files matching
the name/predicate pair. See
<a href="//lsub.org/sys/man/3/names.html">names(3)</a> for a
description and examples of names and predicates.
<p>
Standard I/O in Clive happens through channels of arbitrary data types
but these conventions hold:
<ul>
    <li>Only <code>[]byte</code> messages are considered
    actual data to be processed.
    <li><code>zx.Dir</code> directory entries indicate to
    which file the following data refers to.
    <li>All other (unknown) messages are to be forwarded to the output
    when read from the input.
</ul>
Most commands rely on these conventions so that, for example, a
command lists files and retrieves file data from the server and
following commands in a shell pipe-line operate on such data without
knowing how to retrieve files from the server. For example:
<p><ul style="list-style:none;">
    <code><pre>
    ; gf src,- | gr  func | pf
    </pre></code>
</ul><p>
gets regular files under the <code>src</code> directory
and sends them to <code>gr</code> to select lines
containing <code>func</code>, which sends the result to
<code>pf</code> to print the result.
<p>
A Clive command may be given input files either through the standard
input or, if the command accepts that, by supplying names in the
command line. Names are a combination of a file name and a predicate.
Note that more than one file can be sent either way. Clive is not
UNIX.
<p>
Many commands accept a <code>-u</code> flag that makes
them issue output for UNIX, and not for clive. That is the default in
<code>pf</code>. By default, all commands process the
standard stream of messages and so they would not work as expected if
they are fed by a unix output stream or their output is sent to a unix
device or command. The commands <code>rf</code> and
<code>pf</code> convert a UNIX stream to a Clive stream
and vice-versa. For example
<p><ul style="list-style:none;">
    <code><pre>
    ; seq 15 | rf | gr 1 | pf
    </pre></code>
<p>
</ul><p>
Alien commands are relegated to using the FUSE provided services and
are not aware of the Clive name spaces.
<p>
<ul>
    <li>This section documents shell commands.
    <li>Section 2 documents source packages (in Go).
    <li>Section 3 documents conventions.
<p>
</ul>
The synopsys in the commands follows the UNIX style, but uses curly
brackets to indicate flags that may be repeated multiple times.
<p>
<a name="sec3"></a><h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
To import the main tree using the ZX file protocol:
<p><ul style="list-style:none;">
    <code><pre>
    ; Importzx
    </pre></code>
</ul><p>
which does something like:
<p><ul style="list-style:none;">
    <code><pre>
    ; zxfuse -n &#39;tcp!crun.lsub.org!zx!dump&#39; /dump&amp;
    ; zxfuse -v &#39;tcp!crun.lsub.org!zx!main&#39; /zx&amp;
    ...
    </pre></code>
<p>
</ul><p>
To work on your local tree, in the environment set by the commands in
the synopsys:
<p><ul style="list-style:none;">
    <code><pre>
    ; export GOBIN=/zx/usr/$USER/bin/$CPUTYPE
    ; export GOPATH=/zx/usr/$USER/gosrc
    ; go install ....
    </pre></code>
<p>
</ul><p>
To work in the system, in the same environment:
<p><ul style="list-style:none;">
    <code><pre>
    ; export GOBIN=/zx/bin/$CPUTYPE
    ; export GOPATH=/zx/sys
    ; go install ....
    </pre></code>
</ul><p>
or
<p><ul style="list-style:none;">
    <code><pre>
    ; Go install ...
    </pre></code>
<p>
</ul><p>
See <a href="//lsub.org/sys/man/2/intro.html">intro(2)</a> for an
implementation example of a hello-world clive command.
