<h2>IX(1): ink shell and command executor</h2>
<hr>
<p>

<a name="sec1"></a><h2>USAGE</h2>
<p><ul style="list-style:none;">
    <code><pre>
    usage: ix [-DIn] [-l file] {file}
        -D: debug
        -I: debug ink
        -l file: load the session from the given file
        -n: dry run (don&#39;t ever save)
    </pre></code>
<p>
</ul><p>
<a name="sec2"></a><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<em>Ix</em> is a shell using the [net/ink(2)], web based,
graphics interface. It lets the user browse the file system, execute
commands, edit files, and open other ink interfaces (including web
pages and interfaces from other tools in the system).
<p>
The interface is reached on the ink port using a Web browser.
Initially, a command window is created. Other command windows and
further edits may be open using it. The words near the top are
buttons:
<ul>
    <li><code>more</code>: increases the number of columns
    in the page.
    <li><code>less</code>: decreases the number of columns
    in the page.
    <li><code>win</code>: opens a new command window.
    <li><code>quit</code>: quits IX.
<p>
</ul>
IX ancestors (O/live, Omero, and Acme) inspired much of the mouse
language. If you know how to use one of those, you almost know how to
use IX. Mouse buttons are named 1, 2, 3, and 4 (left to right).
Function keys (starting at F1) may be used as mouse buttons. Function
key F12 toggles debug in the browser console.
<p>
Each window is decorated with a status line. A click on the icons
shown in the line may be used to close the window, save it (only shown
if the window has unsaved changed), minimize all windows in the same
column, make the window larger, make it smaller, and resize it to make
its bottom the bottom of the column. A click on the rest of the status
line shifts the windows in the column, moving the top window to the
end of the column. Windows may be dragged and moved to another
location using button-1 on the status line.
<p>
The status line shows a label written in black when the window is
clean. The label is written in blue when the window is dirty (and
should be saved). The status line background is shown in a lighter
color when the window has the focus, and it is darkern when the window
is not the focus.
<p>
A click with button-1 on a window sets it as the focus. However, the
keyboard follows the mouse and writes at the window under the mouse
pointer. You can type commands in a window and use another one as the
focus for them.
<p>
The width of a window depends on the number of columns and cannot be
adjusted by the user. The height of a window can be adjusted by
dragging its bottom line with the mouse.
<p>
Button-1 sets the selection. It is empty for a single click, a word
for a double click, and a long word for a tripple click. A long word
accepts more runes as word characters. A double click on a rune that
seems to delimit a range (like brackets, quotes, etc.) selects the
enclosed text. A double click at the end of the line selects the
entire line. To select more text than shown in a window, use the
scroll wheel while holding down button-1.
<p>
While holding down button-1, a click with button-2 cuts the selected
text, and a click with button-3 replaces the selected text with a
paste of the clipboard. A chick with button-4 while holding down
button-1 copies the selection into the clipboard. Keys
<em>Command</em>-!x!, <em>Command</em>-!v!,
and <em>Command</em>-!c!, achieve the same effect.
<p>
Commands are executed with the button-2, either with a single click or
with a selection. New edits can be looked for with the button-3,
either with a single click or with a selection. Text search happens
when using button-4, which searches for the last text selected
(perhaps at a different window) on the clicked window. Executing a
directory in a commands window changes the dot to that directory.
Executing it in a directory window replaces the directory shown with
the one executed.
<p>
For buttons 2 and 3, a click at the end of a line refers to the whole
line, a click on a word refers on the whole word, and a click on a
selection refers to the text selected. A click on a final empty line
selects the previous line.
<p>
The mouse wheel scrolls up and down the text shown in the window. When
used outside a window it scrolls the whole page (or screen). Up and
down array keys also scroll text in windows.
<p>
A thin blue line on the right of text windows depicts the location of
the text shown within the full text. The size of the line is
proportional to the percentage of text shown and its position
indicates the location of the shown text. This line cannot be used to
scroll.
<p>
The left and right arrow keys do not move the cursor, but perform undo
and redo operations.
<p>
There is no command language (although there are some builtins).
Commands executed are standard
<a href="//lsub.org/sys/man/1/ql.html">ql(1)</a> commands, unless
they are a builtin. IX serves a standard output
<em>ink</em> channel to all commands executed in it.
Commands with user interfaces rely on this to use the relevant IX
instance. But note how
<p><ul style="list-style:none;">
    <code><pre>
    eco  http://lsub.org &gt;[out:ink]
    </pre></code>
</ul><p>
and similar commands can be used to output URLs, or HTML in general,
to the standard output <em>ink</em> and convince IX to
display external interfaces or resources. When a command outputs a
file address (or more), IX selects that address as a result, and
button-3 clicks on such selection iterates through the address list.
<p>
Ink messages starting with <code>exec:</code> are
understood as requests to execute commands and display its output in a
new window. Those starting with <code>look:</code> are
understood as requests to look for text.
<p>
The variable <code>$look</code>, or the file
<code>$home/lib/look</code>, or
<code>$home/.look</code> are used to learn rules to
execute commands when the user looks for text.
<p>
Command windows operate like a typescript. Upon command execution, the
command output will get inserted on the line after the end of the
command. Each window operates in its own Clive command context and may
use a different name space, dot, etc.
<p>
The builtin commands are:
<ul>
    <li><code>cd</code>: changes the directory to that of
    the focus (if no argument is given) or to that given.
    <li><code>pwd</code>: print the current directory.
    <li><code>cmds</code>: list the running commands.
    <li><code>=</code>: print the dot (the selection of the
    focus).
    <li><code>n file</code>: create a new edit for the named
    file.
    <li><code>w [file]</code>: write the focus, if dirty,
    back to disk. If the file name is given, it is written to that file
    and the edit is updated to operate on the new name.
    <li><code>e</code>: re-read the focus, discarding all
    edits, and start a new edit.
    <li><code>d</code>: delete the focus.
    <li><code>u</code>: undo the last edit.
    <li><code>r</code>: redo the last undo.
    <li><code>&gt; cmds...</code>: run commands using the dot
    as input.
    <li><code>&lt; cmds...</code>: run commands inserting their
    output at the dot.
    <li><code> |cmds...</code>: filter the dot with
    commands.
    <li><code>x [expr] cmd</code>: run command for all
    selections of edits matching expr.
    <li><code>X [expr] cmd</code>: run command for all edits
    matching expr.
    <li><code>. cmd...</code>: run command on the dot.
    <li><code>, cmd...</code>: run command on the focus.
    <li><code>dump [name]</code>: print the state of the
    session or dump it into the given file name, if any.
    <li><code>load name</code>: load the session edits
    dumped at the given file name.
    <li><code>win</code>: start a new commands window.
    <li><code>rules</code>: reload the look rules.
<p>
</ul>
All other commands are external Clive commands.
<p>
Typing <em>Esc</em> twice at a window clears the window.
For command windows, the text is cleared. For directory windows, the
directory is re-read. For text edits, the edits are discarded and the
on-disk text is re-read.
<p>
Text processing happens for keys supplied by the browser (which might
or might not take into account your keyboard layout and locale
settings). Nevertheless, the <em>Alt</em> key may be used
to compose a key by typing <em>Alt</em> and then one or
more keys. The valid sequences are those of Plan 9 from Bell Labs. See
<a href="//lsub.org/sys/man/3/keyboard.html">keyboard(3)</a> for a
description of valid key sequences.
<p>
<a name="sec3"></a><h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
Open all go files under the current dir:
<p><ul style="list-style:none;">
    Type
    <code><pre>
    .,~*.go
    </pre></code>
</ul><p>
and right-click on it.
<p>
Find foo in the current edit: Type
<p><ul style="list-style:none;">
    <code><pre>
    , &gt;gr -x foo
    </pre></code>
</ul><p>
and middle-click on it. If you click (button-3) on one of the
addresses printed by <code>gr</code>, the selection is
changed. If you click on one of those selections (button-3), the next
address located by <code>gr</code> is looked for. If you
click on one of those selections (button-4), the next instance of
selected text is looked for.
<p>
Replace foo with bar in all edits: Type
<p><ul style="list-style:none;">
    <code><pre>
    X |trex foo bar
    </pre></code>
</ul><p>
and middle click on it.
<p>
Save everything: Type
<p><ul style="list-style:none;">
    <code><pre>
    X w
    </pre></code>
</ul><p>
and middle click on it.
<p>
Teach IX to show manual pages and to use the OS browser to open URLs,
and teach it to open PostScript and PDF files by itself.
<p><ul style="list-style:none;">
    <code><pre>
    look=&#39;# rules for look(2), used by ix(1)
    ^([a-zA-Z.]+)\(([0-9]+)\)$
        doc \2 \1|rf
        ^https://localhost
            not
    ^(http|https)://.*$
        open \0
    ^.*\.(ps|pdf)$
        eco file://^&lt;{path \0} &#39;|&#39; \0 &gt;[out:ink]
    &#39;
    ix &amp;
    </pre></code>
